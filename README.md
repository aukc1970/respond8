# Respond

Respond 8 is a fun way to build fast, beautiful, and reliable static websites.  It is not only an amazing static site generator, but it also allows you to manage your site after it is created.  Respond 8 is built entirely in JavaScript.  It uses module based JavaScript on the client and Express JS on the backend.  Respond 8 takes a component based approach to building websites.  So, there are no themes built into Respond.  Rather, we give you an awesome theme builder to pick and choose a site design that suits your taste.
